Question: Randomized priority queue. Describe how to add the methods 𝚜𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎() and 𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚁𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖() to our binary heap implementation. The two methods return a key that is chosen uniformly at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method also removing that key. The 𝚜𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎() method should take constant time; the 𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚁𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖() method should take logarithmic time. Do not worry about resizing the underlying array.

Answer:

Randomly choose index i from 1 to N, where N is the size of the priority queue binary heap implementation. sample()'s value is a[i]. To delRandom(), we can exchange item of a[i] and a[N], then null out a[N], and sink a[i].
