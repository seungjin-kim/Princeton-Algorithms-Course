// Question: Social network connectivity. Given a social network containing N members and a log file 
// containing M timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to 
// determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of 
// a friend of a friend â€¦ of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that 
// friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be MlogN or better 
// and use extra space proportional to N.

// My solution: Add a count for number of connected component(s). Think of N members as N objects, and regard M
// timestamps as M unions. Then, "the earliest time at which all members are connected" is the time when 
// count is equal to 1.
